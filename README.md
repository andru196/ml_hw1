# Sberbank Russian Housing Market
### Download data from https://www.kaggle.com/c/sberbank-russian-housing-market
pip install kaggle
https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api
o use the Kaggle API, sign up for a Kaggle account at https://www.kaggle.com. Then go to the 'Account' tab of your user profile (https://www.kaggle.com/<username>/account) and select 'Create API Token'. This will trigger the download of kaggle.json, a file containing your API credentials. Place this file in the location ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json (on Windows in the location C:\Users\<Windows-username>\.kaggle\kaggle.json - you can check the exact location, sans drive, with echo %HOMEPATH%). You can define a shell environment variable KAGGLE_CONFIG_DIR to change this location to $KAGGLE_CONFIG_DIR/kaggle.json (on Windows it will be %KAGGLE_CONFIG_DIR%\kaggle.json).
For your security, ensure that other users of your computer do not have read access to your credentials. On Unix-
